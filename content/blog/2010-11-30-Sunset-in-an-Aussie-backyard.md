This was taken on 28 Nov 2010

For this HDR image I worked in Photoshop a lot more to blend the silhouetted parts better.

Probably not obvious enough but what makes this an Aussie backyard is the antenna on the roof.  To me, low-rise houses with lots of land and antennas sticking out of every roof is what reminds me of an Aussie backyard.  Add in a giant BBQ and there would be no doubt.
