[Trey Ratcliff's][1] work has been really inspiring me as of late.

There's nothing really special about the photos. Â They were taken more so I could practice the tone mapping technique. I didn't go too crazy with the "HDR look" - but it was hard to hold back!

All I would note is that a tripod is a must!

I just love the ability to bring the texture of the wood out. (who said it was an ugly table? =P)

Oh...and I think I'm over the whole watermarking thing too...
