I finally acquired enough video editting knowledge (still very basic) and inspiration to put together this video below.

The inspiration for the technique comes from @TreyRatcliff at [Stuckincustoms][1].  After I saw his video using this technique I knew straight away I would use this technique to share my next batch of holiday photos - luckily I didn't need to wait till then because I had a bunch of photos from my New Zealand trip from 2009 rotting away on my hard drive.  I think this is a really great way to share lots of photos in a quick and exciting way and the technique is simple enough that a lot of people can do it.

I am in the process of putting together a how-to post on how I put together this video.  Hopefully, that will be finished and posted up soon.

This process that has occurred here reminds me of a post Chase Jarvis wrote recently [here][2], excerpt below (emphasis added):
> "IMHO, this is a great chronicle **of the new era of making stuff in the world**. Raw artistry, is put out into the world. Feedback and collaboration result. Fans and friends help support the making of this art. **Great work gets made and shared, and the recipe of how it was all pulled off is given back to the world for consumption, edification, and repetition.**"

That last part is an ideology that I only learned about in the last 6 month and something I am starting to really believe in.

In my context, Trey Ratcliff has put together a video in quite a creative way, he has been kind enough to make a how-to video which has in turn allowed me to make my version.  I have tweaked it a little bit and will pass on how I did it.

This is an example of how the internet is democratising content and knowledge and ultimately encouraging creativity.  An innately non-creative person like me can now find great quality resources for free and learn to be creative.

Exciting times ahead.
