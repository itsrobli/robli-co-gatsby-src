I tried hard to create the glowing lights and after taking a pot shot with this single HDR image, I realised that given the low voltage of the Christmas tree fairy lights, I had to contrast the luminosity of it with a dark room (i.e. long exposure). Â I thought a simple HDR would do the trick, but the difference between darkness and brightness has to be there in the first place.
