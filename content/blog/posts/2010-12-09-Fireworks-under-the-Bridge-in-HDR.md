I'm quite pleased with this attempt as it was the first time I had to do heavy Photoshop masking work.

With some previous pictures, I was too lazy to fix some minor issues.  However, as the fireworks were going off pretty quickly, I had to mask in the best version.  Along with that, I had to mask in the ambient red light from that version of the autobracket.  ISO had to be shot at 800 given I wanted the fireworks trails to not be too blurred.

Finished it off by removing some of the halos from the bridge (due to car lights I guess) which were exaggerated by the HDR technique.
