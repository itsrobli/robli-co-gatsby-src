In my quest to take more photos, I am having a lot of fun with the iPhone.  Creating photos and sharing via [Instagram][1], [Flickr][2], [Facebook][3] etc.

Given the medium, I think the most can be gained by focusing on composition.  An interesting thing I've noticed is that given the iPhone is such a common sight nowadays, nobody takes notice of what you're doing with it.

If you look carefully at the photo in the top right corner, you can see a face in the silhouette.  No photoshop, no manipulation.  Simply caught by pure chance.  A reminder that photography captures fleeting moments, so gotta be out there more...taking photos.

I'll take that as a positive sign.

Although the scenes above are mundane to me given I see the same thing every day...this may not always be the case.  Things change.
