In my minds eye I wanted to burn in the light from the lightsabre which would create enough ambient light to show some movement and then fire a strobe at the end to give a clear, sharp picture.  I ended up really disliking the red from the lightsabre and the way it mixed in with the trail of my movement...would have been better with a more unnatural colour like purple...something that was completely different from skin colour.

Experimenting with it all was overall quite fun and taught me a lot about how light falls on a subject depending on the positioning of the softbox.  I was quite satisfied that I knew what was going wrong as I made my path to the desired image.

In the end, I knew I had the image on my last try.
