We [heard last year][1] all about Everpix having to shutdown.

Everpix [released yesterday][2] a gold mine of data about their experiences as a startup. It includes everything from financial data about their operations to pitch slides to venture capital firms.

They have done a huge service to almost anyone looking to start their own business by releasing such detailed intelligence - especially software developers.

> Here are some example of common startup questions this dataset helps answering:
> 
> - What are investment terms for consecutive convertible notes and an equity seed round? What does the end cap table look like?
> - How does a Silicon Valley startup spend its raised money during 2 years?
> - What does a VC pitch deck look like?
> - What kinds of reasons do VCs give when they pass?
> - What are the open rate and click rate of transactional and marketing emails?
> - What web traffic do various news websites generate? (see here and here)
> - What are the conversion rate from product landing page to sign up for new visitors?
> - How fast do people purchase a subscription after signing up to a freemium service? (see here and here)
> - Which countries have higher suscription rates? (see here and here)

The most interesting data I found (in the short 10-20 minutes I spent looking) is evidence supporting the proposition that people who used Everpix loved Everpix. You can see below the retention rate of paying users is at almost 100%.

I feel it is a great shame that Everpix couldn't raise the money they needed. It wasn't a lot in the grand scheme of things (especially when considering what garbage is funded nowadays).
