Consistency is so important.  When looking through a series of photos done well, there are no distractions.  The photos just blend into each other really well...just great flow.

I recently tried to create the same look by processing the photos consistently.  It was a bit of a hit and miss, but I can can appreciate how difficult this task is.

I'm a fan of this look.  I'm about 80% happy with it.  If the foot wasn't cut off and if there was just a bit more separation between the arm and post.  Shooting good photos isn't enough - which is hard enough in itself - but doing it consistently...that's the key.
