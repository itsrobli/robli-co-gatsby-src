I've been learning a lot from [Mr Zack Arias][1]...really good technical resource.

My first photoshoot using lighting and what an experience.  Technically, I think I was ok.  The light was disappearing fast and I could perform that well under some mild pressure.  Composition was decent and saved with some cropping.  Posing was the real victim, obviously an area for improvement as I this was the part that came least naturally.

I can imagine if I was doing a shoot of a stranger I'd have to build rapport and get to know them on top of everything else.  I've still got a ways to go. Loving the journey though.
