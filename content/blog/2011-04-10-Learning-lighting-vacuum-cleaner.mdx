I've been learning a lot about lighting lately.  Generally just the basics i.e. correct exposure by balancing flash power and camera settings.  Doing it all on manual to understand what everything does.  [Zack Arias' creativeLIVE course][1] is really good for learning this.

The photo below is just a sample.  Balancing ambient lighting with the SB-900 and also experimenting with a warm gel on the flash to give that sport illustrated look.  The attractive model is my vacuum cleaner.

I should be receiving my softbox within the week to practice more.
