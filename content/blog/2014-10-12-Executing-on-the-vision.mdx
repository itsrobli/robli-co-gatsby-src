This is a video of Steve Jobs in 1997 doing an informal Q&A with Apple developers at WWDC.

When I watch this video, what amazes meÂ is that he was able to execute on all of these ideas he had for the future of Apple and the tech industry.

I strongly believe that ideas are worth shit. It's the ability to execute and deliver a product that matters. It's the only thing that matters.
