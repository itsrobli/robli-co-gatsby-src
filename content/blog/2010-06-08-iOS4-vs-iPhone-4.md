The new iPhone came out today and I have to say I'm looking forward to the new OS!

Finally I'll have multi-tasking and a way to organise the bunch of apps scattered around.

Sure I'll miss the build quality of the iPhone 4, but can't really justify ditching an 11 month old phone for a couple of 5 mega-pixel cameras and HD video recording.

So while others get excited about iPhone 4, I get to be excited about iOS 4! 50% of the features, 0% of the cost.

Thanks Apple.
