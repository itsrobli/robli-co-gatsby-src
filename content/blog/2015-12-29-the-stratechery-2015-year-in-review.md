A great collection of [the best articles from Stratechery](https://stratechery.com/2015/the-stratechery-2015-year-in-review/) in 2015.

My blog is not a [link blog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linklog). I am linking to this because, throughout 2015, Stratechery has been a consistent instigator for my own critical thinking.

Many of my own blogs started from a theme or theory discussed in the Stratechery blog or [podcast](http://exponent.fm). I have also shamelessly copied Stratecheryâ€™s diagram/drawing style by using the [Paper by 53 app](https://www.fiftythree.com)[^1]. 

Another good resource is [Benedict Evans](http://ben-evans.com/).

[^1]:	Great app by the way.
