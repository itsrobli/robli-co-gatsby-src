I've been watching a lot of tutorials these past few weeks. Some good, some boring, some amazing. I find I learn best when it's just a pro doing their thing and talking through what and why they're doing. Especially great is Jeremy Cowart. His [stuff][1] is just really outside the box...so creative...and inspirational.

When I first got my Canon 450D, I was overwhelmed by the amount of buttons and settings available. Moving on to the Nikon D700, with even more buttons and settings, I'm happy that I know what each one does. I am even happier that I understand why certain options (that may appear to be redundant at first) are available and I can imagine some obscure situation where having that setting as an option would be useful.

In summary, the journey continues...
