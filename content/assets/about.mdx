Programming

- In 2022, I refreshed my iOS development skills by creating a new app, [Know Time Zones][22], in SwiftUI.

- In 2021, I wanted to re-visit what front-end web development was like so I re-built this website using [Gatsby][21]. It allowed me to get hands-on with modern JavaScript, React, and GraphQL.

- I am interested in data and analytics and in particular how it can be more accessible with better tooling. In 2020, I co-wrote [this article][1a]. I am a fan of using Python and SQL for data analytics.

- In 2018 and 2019, I experimented with machine learning [here][16] and wrapped it in [Django to demo][16b]. I originally deployed the Django app on a VPS and manually configured and managed the web server and database server (I won't do that again).

- In 2019, I played around with stat models [here][16a] to predict the 2019 AFL season because I haven't played/followed footy since school but I wanted to take part in the tipping comp. Overall, it performed ok but notably did 100% accuracy in one of the rounds.

- In 2014, I made Timely, a time recording web app for use at work. It allowed my teammates to conveniently track time they spent on projects for billing and costing purposes. I built it as a simple CRUD web app using PHP without any app frameworks. It was the first app I made and I learned a lot about authentication and data capture.

- In 2014, I made [Where To][1], an iPhone app that finds a place nearby to go to when you're out with friends and everyone's response to "where to?" is "I don't mind, anywhere is cool with me." I wrote it in Objective-C and used Google's Places API to find interesting places. I am still maintaining this app for iOS changes. It doesn't make any money or have any users but I enjoy keeping informed about the Apple development platforms.

- In 2014, I had a list of suggestions of places to eat in NYC from a recent trip. Along with my photos from the trip, I wrapped it up in some HTML, CSS and JavaScript and called itÂ [New York City Eats][2]. I hadn't made a website since using HTML, [marquees][2a], and frame in 1997 - it was interesting to say the least.

Photos and videos

- You can see my photos [here][5] and all over [my blog posts][6] and [websites][7].

- In 2015, I made this video reviewing the [Apple Pencil][17] when it was first released.

- In 2011, I photographed a [wedding][8] and [engagement][9].

- In 2011, I worked with [Vantage Interactive][3] on [this little ad][4] for the UNSW School of Mining Engineering. I did the majority of the video editing.


## Technical

I made Version 2 [of this website][20] using [Gatsby][21].

I made Version 1 [of this website][10] using [Middleman][11]. It's a static site generator and uses many of the tools from the [Ruby][12] web development world.

You can verify my ownership of this domain on [Keybase][19].
