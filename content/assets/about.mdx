I love programming.

- I am interested in how modern software development techniques can improve tedious tasks at home and in large organisations. I am currently exprimenting with how machine learning might achieve this in industry [here][16]. In the past, I made Timely, a time recording web app for use at work. It allowed my teammates to conveniently track time they spent on projects for billing and costing purposes.

- I made [Where To][1], an iPhone app that finds a place nearby to go to when you're out with friends and everyone's response to "where to?" is "I don't mind, anywhere is cool with me."

- I had a list of suggestions of places to eat in NYC. Along with my photos from the trip, I wrapped it up in some HTML, CSS and JavaScript and called it [New York City Eats][2].

I also enjoy photography and making videos. 

- You can see my photos [here][5] and all over [my blog posts][6] and [websites][7]. I have photographed a [wedding][8] and [engagement][9].

- I worked with [Vantage Interactive][3] on [this little ad][4] for the UNSW School of Mining Engineering. I did the majority of the video editing.

- I made this video reviewing the [Apple Pencil][17] when it was first released.

## Technical

I [made this website][10] using [Middleman][11]. It's a static site generator and uses many of the tools from the [Ruby][12] web development world. 

You can verify my ownership of this domain on [Keybase][19].
